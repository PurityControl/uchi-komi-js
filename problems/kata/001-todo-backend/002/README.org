#+TITLE: KATA 002 for ToDo Backend (22/11/2016)

* Sitting one - going for shameless green.
The first commit of the kata is going for shameless green.
There has been no refactoring just getting the code to green based on
the results of tests.
The next stage should focus on the refactor cycle trying to improve
the code in discrete steps without ever breaking the tests.

Running the tests on localhost with a local postgresdb the tests run
in about 0.4s.
