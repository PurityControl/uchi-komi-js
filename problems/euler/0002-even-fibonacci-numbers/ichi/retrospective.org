#+TITLE: Retrospective for even fibonaccis problem.

* Running the project
- run "npm test"

* Retrospective
Simple first implmentation more about process of setting up npm and testing.

*Process Followed
- npm init => fill in requested information
  - this includes giving path to mocha that doesn't exist yet
  - node_modules/.bin/mocha
- install testing framework and save to package.json
  - npm install mocha --save-dev
  - npm install chai --save-dev
- require chai correctly
  - var assert = require("chai").assert;

*TODO
set up a yeoman template that implements this and gulp which automates
unit testing.

This retrospective has been copy pasted from euler problem 0001 but
all the above reccomendations still stand.
